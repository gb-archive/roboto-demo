Demo compo entry for Skrolli Party 2017,
programmed in Sharp LR35902 assembly for the original Game Boy (DMG).


How to assemble
---------------
The assembly code is written for [RGBDS assembler](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds). The whole demo can be compiled and tested using the [BGB emulator](http://bgb.bircd.org/) on Windows just by running `run.bat`

Project structure
-----------------
The starting point of the program is in the file [skrollidemo.z80](skrollidemo.z80). Interrupt boilerplate code can be found in [interrupts.z80](interrupts.z80) file. Cartridge header can be found in [header.z80](header.z80).

The demo is divided into separate scenes, which reside in their respective `scene_*.z80` files.

RGBDS, mod2gbt and BGB executables are contained in the *requirements* directory.

Libraries
---------
This demo uses the great [gbt-player](https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player) tools by Antonio Niño Díaz (AntonioND), and [RGBGrafx](http://www.aaronstj.com/files/rgbgrafx.zip) by Aaron St. John.

The author does not take any legal responsibility for the safety of the code in case you e.g. decide to repurpose parts of it to run a space craft or a nuclear plant. In case you do so, please contact me. I'd like to see a space craft controlled by a Game Boy.
